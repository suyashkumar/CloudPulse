#CloudPulse
My cloud connected pulse plethysmograph project. My goals with this project were to design and develop a straightforward "connected" medical device from the ground up. This continues to be a super fun project involving analog electronics, firmware, frontend, backend, and even 3D printing work (much still is ongoing).

This project was recenly rebuilt using NodeJS + MongoDB for backend and an AngularJS front end (using the Angular Material framework). 

More coming soon!
